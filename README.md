The QR-code generator is an application which can generate different types of QR-codes. Currently
the application supports the following codes:

- Text: encoding a text (like a hyper-link) inside a QR-code 
- EPC (European Payments Council): payment requests

For more info about the features of the application goto the [wiki](https://github.com/wim07101993/qr_code_generator/wiki).

## Platforms

The application is available for Android, Linux, Windows and the web. They can be found on the
[release page on github](https://github.com/wim07101993/qr_code_generator/releases). The android 
app can also be downloaded on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wimvanlaer.qr_code_generator).
I plan to support the Microsoft store and Linux snaps. The submission for the Microsoft store has
been made and is in review. For Linux snaps I wait for the official support from the flutter team.

## Contributing

The application is written in Flutter/Dart. And has no dependencies except for the standard platform
dependencies as described by flutter. For more information on installing flutter and the necessary
dependencies go to [flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
